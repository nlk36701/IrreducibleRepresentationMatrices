# IrreducibleRepresentationMatrices
Irreducible representation matrices for the molecular point groups found in Cotton's "Chemical Applications of Group Theory"
To the best of our knowledge, there currently exists no other library of readily downloadable irreducible representation matrices
for the afformation point groups. Moreso, the representation matrices for *I*<sub>h</sub> often need code to generate them. 

Well here they are, ready to be downloaded and used within Julia (dictionary), Python (dictionary), or Mathematica (association). 
Matrices were checked for correctness using the Great Orthogonality Theorem. 

The mathematica notebook is setup to display the irreducible representation matrices as a grid, with the group's irrep and operation
symbols present. 

Please use responsibly.
